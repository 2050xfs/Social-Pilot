# SocialPilot AI: Vision

## Purpose
SocialPilot AI is an agentic social media suite that helps users research a niche, synthesize strategy, generate a 30‑day content plan, and simulate execution so they can iterate quickly before publishing to real platforms. The product’s core promise is to compress days of analysis and planning into minutes while preserving brand consistency and measurable momentum.

## North Star Outcomes
- **Time-to-strategy**: generate a research-backed 30‑day plan within minutes.
- **Content readiness**: produce visuals and captions that match the synthesized persona DNA.
- **Predictable execution**: simulate posting cadence and queue health to evaluate performance before real posting.
- **User confidence**: provide clear, inspectable reasoning artifacts (personas, hooks, funnel stages, visuals).

## Target Users
- **Creators** who want to scale output without losing their voice.
- **Brands** that need consistent, funnel-based campaigns.
- **Agencies** that manage multiple niches and want rapid research and production.

## Experience Principles
- **Transparent AI**: surface persona DNA and plan rationale so the user can audit choices.
- **Workflow clarity**: every step has a visible state (Scheduled → Processing → Posted).
- **Quality over volume**: visuals and captions are coherent with the persona’s aesthetic.
- **Fast iteration**: batch generation and simulation allow quick exploration of strategies.

## Product Scope (MVP → V1)
- **MVP**: niche input → competitor research → plan generation → simulated posting.
- **V1**: batch asset generation, in‑modal edits, queue management, analytics simulation.

## Success Metrics
- Median time to generate full plan.
- Percentage of users who view persona details before accepting plan.
- Ratio of posts with generated visuals vs. placeholder.
- User retention across multiple campaigns.
